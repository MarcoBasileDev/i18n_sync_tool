# Localization Sync Tool

### **Synchronize your translation files and bridge the gap between languages.**

This Python utility is designed to manage of multi-language applications. It compares a **Source** translation file (your most up-to-date version, e.g., English) against multiple **Targofet** files (e.g., Italian, Spanish, French) to identify missing keys.

Instead of manually hunting for what's missing, this tool generates a "ready-to-translate" snippet that you can simply copy-paste into an **LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude)** to complete your localization in seconds.

## Key Features

* **Hybrid Parsing:** Reads standard `.json` files and `.js` / `.ts` files using `export const` structures.
* **Deep Extraction:** Uses advanced Regex to capture multi-line strings and various quoting styles (`'` or `"`).
* **LLM-Ready Output:** Generates helper files in the `output/` directory formatted specifically for easy AI translation.
* **Organized Workflow:** Keeps your workspace clean by separating input data from generated results.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `os`, `re`, and `json` modules).

## 📂 Setup & Project Structure

To use the tool, organize your files as follows:

```text
/your-project-folder
├── input/               <-- Place your translation files here (.json, .js, .ts)
├── output/              <-- The script will create this and put results here
└── sync_tool.py         <-- Python script
```
---

Once you've created a folder named `input` and copied all the translation files you want to compare into it, open the terminal in the project folder and run the script:

```bash
python sync_tool.py
```

---

The script will list all files found in the `input` folder. Enter the index number corresponding to your **Master** file (the one that contains the most recent updates).

---

The console will display a summary for every file:
- **Common keys**: How many keys match the source.
- **Missing keys**: How many keys are present in the source but absent in the target.

---

Check the output folder for files named missing_in_[target_filename].txt.
Now you can copy-paste the contents of these files into your LLM and complete the translation.

## 🔍 Example Output
If your `es.js` is missing keys compared to `en.js`, the generated file in output/ will look like this:

```JavaScript
// MISSING KEYS IN es.js
// Source file: en.js
// Generated by localization sync tool

WELCOME: 'Welcome',
LOGOUT_CONFIRM: 'Are you sure you want to leave?',
```
