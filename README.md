# Localization Sync Tool

### **Synchronize your translation files and bridge the gap between languages.**

This Python utility is designed to manage of multi-language applications. It compares a **Source** translation file (your most up-to-date version, e.g., English) against multiple **Targofet** files (e.g., Italian, Spanish, French) to identify missing keys.

Instead of manually hunting for what's missing, this tool generates a "ready-to-translate" snippet that you can simply copy-paste into an **LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude)** to complete your localization in seconds.
