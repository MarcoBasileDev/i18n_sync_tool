# Localization Sync Tool

### **Synchronize your translation files and bridge the gap between languages.**

This Python utility is designed to manage of multi-language applications. It compares a **Source** translation file (your most up-to-date version, e.g., English) against multiple **Target** files (e.g., Italian, Spanish, French) to identify missing keys.

Instead of manually hunting for what's missing, this tool generates a "ready-to-translate" snippet that you can simply copy-paste into an **LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude)** to complete your localization in seconds.

## Key Features

* **Hybrid Parsing:** Reads standard `.json` files and `.js` / `.ts` files using `export const` structures.
* **Deep Extraction:** Uses advanced Regex to capture multi-line strings and various quoting styles (`'` or `"`).
* **LLM-Ready Output:** Generates helper files in the `output/` directory formatted specifically for easy AI translation.
* **Organized Workflow:** Keeps your workspace clean by separating input data from generated results.
* **Modern GUI:** A clean, minimal, and intuitive interface built with Eel (HTML/JS/Python).

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `os`, `re`, and `json` modules).

## 📂 Project Structure

If you are running the script manually or building from source, organize your folder like this:

```text
/your-project-folder
├── web/                 <-- UI assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
├── input/               <-- Place your translation files here (.json, .js, .ts)
├── output/              <-- The script will create this and put results here
├── sync_tool.py         <-- Python script
└── files.ico            <-- App icon
```
---

## How to Use
1. **Run the Application**
If you are using the source code, install the requirements (`pip install eel`) and run:
```Bash
python sync_tool.py
```
_Alternatively, just launch the standalone `.exe` from the official Releases._

2. **Upload Files**
**Drag and drop** your translation files directly into the dashed area of the interface. They will be automatically saved into the `input/` folder.

3. **Select Master Source**
   Select your "Master" file (the most updated one) from the dropdown menu and click "Generate Missing Keys".

4. **Copy-Paste Output**
   Check the `output/` folder. Open the `missing_in_[target].txt` files and paste the content into your favorite LLM.

## Building from Source
If you want to compile your own standalone executable instead of using the pre-built release, ensure you have `pyinstaller` installed and run the following command:
```Bash
python -m PyInstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "web;web" --icon=files.ico sync_tool.py
```

## 🔍 Example Output
If your `es.js` is missing keys compared to `en.js`, the generated file in output/ will look like this:

```JavaScript
// MISSING KEYS IN es.js
// Source file: en.js
// Generated by localization sync tool

WELCOME: 'Welcome',
LOGOUT_CONFIRM: 'Are you sure you want to leave?',
```

## ⚠️ Notes on Compatibility

The script is optimized to recognize keys written in **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** (e.g., ACTION_DELETE). It handles values wrapped in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes, including those that span across multiple lines.
